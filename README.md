# Dora, the Adventurous Snake 🐍👩‍💻

Welcome to **Dora, the Adventurous Snake**, a fun and colorful game where you control Dora, the snake, in her quest to collect lilac backpacks and avoid obstacles!

This project, developed as part of my Algorithmic Thinking course, is my unique take on the classic "snake game" 🐍🎮. It was my first time working with Pygame, and I decided to put a personal twist on it by adding a cute theme, narrative, and distinct elements to make the game more engaging. Although it was my first experience with programming logic and Pygame, diving into this challenge was incredibly rewarding. It allowed me to learn a lot, practice python and create something truly original!🌸

## How to Play
1. **Objective**: Help Dora collect 10 lilac backpacks to win the game!
2. **Controls**:
   - Use the **arrow keys** to navigate Dora around the screen.
3. **Rules**:
   - Avoid the orange backpacks 🟠! Swiper left them behind to reduce your score.
   - Hitting walls or colliding with yourself ends the game.
   - Run out of points? Game over!

## Features
- 💜 **Lilac Backpacks**: Collect these to increase your score and grow Dora's tail.
- 🟠 **Orange Backpacks**: Avoid them or your score decreases.
- ⭐ **Dynamic Speed**: Dora moves faster as her size increases for an extra challenge.
- 💕 **Vibrant Design**: Pink, lilac, and orange create an engaging and colorful world.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Pygame Library
